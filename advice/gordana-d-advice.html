                <h2>Confusion is your friend!</h2>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

              <div class="second">
                <h2>It's okay to take a break</h2>
                <p>Do take a break when you think you've hit a wall. It's the best time to reflect on what you've learned so you can understand it.</p>
                <p>Celebrate the fact that you've spent time living outside the comfort zone.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="third">
                <h2>Mistakes are your friends</h2>
                <p>When writing code, make mistakes so you can see how the code works. Expect things to be broken and be kind to yourself.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourth">
                <h2>Most importantly, have fun!</h2>
                <p>You've made the right decision to learn to code. Enjoy the journey &#128521;</p>
